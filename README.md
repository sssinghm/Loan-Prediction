# Credit Risk Prediction Using Random Forest and GridSearchCV
This project involves building a classification model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to fully repay their loan or not. Using a dataset containing credit and demographic information, the goal is to help financial institutions assess credit risk more accurately.

## Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand key factors affecting loan repayment.

Apply data preprocessing techniques including handling categorical variables and missing data.

Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict loan repayment status.

Use GridSearchCV with cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.

Evaluate model performance using classification metrics and confusion matrices.

## Key Techniques Used
Random Forest Classification

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

K-Fold Cross-Validation

Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Feature engineering using one-hot encoding

## Outcome
The final model achieved strong predictive performance and demonstrated the importance of key features like FICO score, credit policy, and loan purpose in determining default risk.
